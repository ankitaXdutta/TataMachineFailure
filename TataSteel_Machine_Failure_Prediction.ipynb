        "This project focuses on predicting **machine failure** using a dataset containing sensor readings and failure records from industrial machines. The dataset includes numerical features such as **Air Temperature, Process Temperature, Rotational Speed, Torque, and Tool Wear**, along with binary indicators for different types of failures: **TWF (Tool Wear Failure), HDF (Heat Dissipation Failure), PWF (Power Failure), OSF (Overstrain Failure), and RNF (Random Failure).** The main objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a machine is likely to fail based on sensor readings, thereby enabling predictive maintenance and reducing operational downtime.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Automating Data Loading via GitHub**  \n",
        "Initially, dataset loading required manual uploads using **Google Colab's file import function**. To streamline the workflow, the dataset was instead **hosted on GitHub**, allowing it to be loaded directly using **Pandas' `read_csv()` function with a raw GitHub URL**. This eliminated the need for repeated manual uploads.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  \n",
        "Extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was performed to understand the nature of the dataset and determine the best preprocessing steps. Various **visualization techniques** such as histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps, and pair plots were used to assess data distributions, detect outliers, and identify relationships between features. The **failure distribution was highly imbalanced**, with failures occurring in a very small percentage of cases. KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) plots and scatter plots helped visualize how different failure types were distributed across numerical features like torque and rotational speed. The insights gained from EDA played a crucial role in designing appropriate **preprocessing techniques** tailored to the dataset’s nature.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**  \n",
        "To prepare the data, unnecessary columns such as **ID, Product ID, and Type** were removed since they did not contribute to failure prediction. A new target variable, **Machine Failure**, was created by combining all individual failure types into a single binary column, where 1 indicates failure and 0 indicates normal operation. The dataset was **normalized** using **StandardScaler** to ensure that all features contributed equally to the model’s learning process, preventing bias from larger numerical values.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Handling Class Imbalance with SMOTE**  \n",
        "Given that failures were underrepresented in the dataset, **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** was applied to artificially increase the number of failure cases. Initially, aggressive SMOTE application resulted in overfitting, where the model achieved near-perfect accuracy on training data but performed poorly on unseen test data. To counter this, **a less aggressive SMOTE approach** was implemented, balancing the failure cases while avoiding excessive duplication of synthetic data. The resampling effect was visualized using KDE plots to ensure that the feature distributions remained realistic after applying SMOTE.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Model Selection and Evaluation**  \n",
        "Various machine learning models were tested, including **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**, to determine the most suitable approach for failure prediction. While **Random Forest and XGBoost** initially showed higher accuracy, they also exhibited signs of overfitting, failing to generalize well to test data. **Logistic Regression** was chosen as a more stable alternative, as it provided a balance between accuracy and generalization, reducing the risk of misleadingly high training performance. The final model was trained with **L2 regularization (Ridge regression)** to further prevent overfitting.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The models were evaluated using multiple performance metrics, including **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC curve** to assess their effectiveness. The **confusion matrix** provided insight into the distribution of false positives and false negatives, which is crucial for failure prediction, as false negatives (missed failures) could lead to costly machine breakdowns. **Precision and recall trade-offs** were analyzed to ensure that the model correctly identified failures without excessively flagging normal operations. The **ROC-AUC curve** measured how well the model distinguished between failed and non-failed machines, ensuring robust decision-making.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Final Results and Insights**  \n",
        "The final model achieved a balanced **accuracy of approximately 99.82%**, meaning it successfully identified most machine failures in the test set. The **precision for failure cases was 89%**, indicating that most failure predictions were correct, with a small number of false positives. **Macro and weighted F1-scores** confirmed strong overall performance. The final model selection prioritized avoiding overfitting while maintaining a high ability to predict failures accurately.  \n",

However, looking at precision and recall, there is a trade-off: the precision for failure cases (1) is only 0.46, meaning a high rate of false positives, but recall is 1.00, meaning the model captures all actual failures. The F1-score of 0.63 for class 1 suggests an imbalance between precision and recall, likely due to SMOTE oversampling. The macro average F1-score of 0.81 highlights that performance is skewed, favoring non-failure cases. The weighted average F1-score of 0.99 reflects the dominance of class 0 (non-failure) in the dataset. While overall accuracy is high, the model struggles with precision for failure cases, making it less reliable for precise failure predictions despite successfully identifying all failures."

It is useful in assessing general performance, ensuring that both failure and non-failure cases are predicted correctly. However, in highly imbalanced datasets where failures are rare, accuracy can be misleading, as the model may achieve high accuracy by mostly predicting \"No Failure\" without actually detecting failures.\n",

This is critical in industrial applications where missing a failure (false negative) can lead to severe consequences such as equipment damage, operational downtime, or safety risks. A high recall ensures that most failures are detected, minimizing potential business losses.\n",

        "**Precision** (Positive Predictive Value) assesses how many of the predicted failures are actually failures. If precision is low, the model generates too many false alarms, leading to unnecessary maintenance costs, inefficient resource allocation, and potential disruptions to operations. A high precision ensures that when the model flags a failure, it is likely to be a real failure, optimizing maintenance efforts.\n"
